# Aganè

Aganè is a tribute to type designer Adrian Frutiger (1918 - 2015), inspired by his font Frutiger (1976) and Avenir (1988). 

Designed in 2017 by Danilo De Marco, It was born from a careful study and analysis of the typefaces Noorda Font by Bob Noorda, Avenir and Frutiger by Adrian Frutiger.

Aganè was designed to be used inside wayfinding signage. 

Aganè S is a variation of Aganè. In this version have been modified the heights of ascending and descending lines of some lowercase letters: b, d, f, g, h i, k, l, p, q, t and y. This design choice leads to an height variation of all capital letters.

This second variation is suitable for wayfinding signage, because is easier to read and use for the moving user.

The planning of the Aganè is inspired by the high Noorda Font’s letters. It was designed by dutch designer Bob Noorda to be used within the visual identity of the Milan’s Metro, inaugurated in 1964. Noorda was able to optimize the signage’s usability, altering proportions of the Helvetica. His work was studied and used afterwards for the signage's design of several world's underground.
